      <p class="information">Henry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City,
        Japan. Once a talented computer hacker, Case was caught stealing from his employer. As punishment for his
        theft, Case's central nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin, leaving him unable to access the global
        computer network in cyberspace, a virtual reality dataspace called the "matrix". Case is unemployable,
        suicidal, and apparently at the top of the hit list of a drug lord named Wage. Case is saved by Molly Millions,
        an augmented "street samurai" and mercenary for a shadowy US ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to
        cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance to regain his life as a "console
        cowboy," but neither Case nor Molly knows what Armitage is really planning. Case's nervous system is repaired
        using new technology that Armitage offers the clinic as payment, but he soon learns from Armitage that sacs of
        the poison that first crippled him have been placed in his blood vessels as well. Armitage promises Case that
        if he completes his work in time, the sacs will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve, disabling him again.
        He also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his liver, leaving Case incapable of
        metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and apparently ending his drug addiction.
